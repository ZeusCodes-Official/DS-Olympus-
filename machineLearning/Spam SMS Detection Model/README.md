# **Spam SMS Detection Model**


## **Aim :-**

The main aim of our model is to detect whether the recieved message is a Spam or a normal message (Ham)

## **Explaination :-**

<ol>
  <li>Initially, we set up the drive and locate the dataset.</li>
  <li>Then, we visualize the training dataset. </li>
  <li>In the next step, Pre-processing is carried out.</li>
  <li>Next, we seperate the Spam and Ham words. </li>
  <li>Then we a predictor function. </li>
  <li>Finally, we take the input to check whether the Message is Spam or Ham. </li>
</ol> 
 


## **Dataset**

There is no such restriction on using a specific dataset. For better prediction, any dataset with proper preprocessing and parameter selection can give you the perfect accuracy.

## **Working of Model**
 <ol>
  <li> Message Example 1 :</li>
<img src="https://github.com/DevIncept-Contribution-Program-21/DS-Olympus-/blob/main/machineLearning/Spam%20SMS%20Detection%20Model/demoPics/Message%20Testing%201.jpeg" width=400><br>

In this image we can see that "Hello, How are You?" is obviously a normal message so, it is classified as not spam with the accuracy of 95.35% 

  <li> Message Example 2 :</li>

<img src="https://github.com/DevIncept-Contribution-Program-21/DS-Olympus-/blob/main/machineLearning/Spam%20SMS%20Detection%20Model/demoPics/Message%20Testing%202.jpeg" width=400><br>

Similarly, in the second image the message "Congrats! you won a lucky draw ref. no. 6362736" seems suspicious so, its is predicted as a Spam by the model with the accuracy of 88.1%
