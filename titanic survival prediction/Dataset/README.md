# About the data

- Predict survival on the Titanic and get familiar with ML basics.


## Attributes in the dataset

- In this , we’ll gain access to two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled `train.csv` and the other is titled `test.csv`.

- Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

- The `test.csv` dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.

- Using the patterns we find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.
