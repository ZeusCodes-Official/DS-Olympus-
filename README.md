**A collection of various data science problems along with it's dataset and solutions in various fields like machine learning, deep learning (image recognition, natural language processing) all at one place**. 

<br>
<br>

## 🚩 What Problem are we looking to solve? 
Recently, many students have leaned towards learning Data Science and look forward to specializing in the field. Now, we do know that there are many great github repos out there that have collection of various resources, but then it's still a huge task to refer those for beginners. DS Olympus aims at solving those problems by creating a collection of various problems in Data Science, featuring -
<Br><br>
✅ The problem we are looking to solve based on the data 
<Br> <br>
✅ Link to dataset. 
<Br> <br>
✅ Most accurate solution to that problem in Jyputer notebook.

## 🚩 Contribution Guide

#### General
* **Never. Repeat. Never** make a pull request directly to the main branch. 
* Fork the repository, and make sure you make pull requests to the branch created by you. (Again, never to the **main** branch)
* Make sure you dm if you have any doubts whatsoever.

#### For DataScience

1. Find great problems related in various fields <Br>
✅ Machine Learning <br>
Machine learning projects will be under "machineLearning" folder.<br>
✅ Deep Learning (Image Recognition, Natural Language Processing, etc)<br>
Deep learning projects will be under "deepLearning" folder.

2. Use "camelCase" for the folder you will be creating - example Project "Hand sign detection" in camelCase will be "handSignDetection". 

3. The folder should contain - <br>
✅ Jyputer Notebook (complete explanation and code to the problem)<br>
✅ Dataset (if it it less than 100MB), Also if you have problems uploading the file or bandwidth issue, make sure you make a section about dataset in Jyputer notebook <br>

#### For WebDev

1. Designing a layout

2. Further points will be clarified soon.
